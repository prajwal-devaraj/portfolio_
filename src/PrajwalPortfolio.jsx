  "Hi, I’m Prajwal. I’m the kind of person who started with curiosity, got pulled into technology, and somewhere along the way ended up building systems, teaching others, writing poetry, and occasionally arguing with my own code at 2 a.m.",
  "Right now, I’m a Software Engineer focused on AI/ML, Backend, Full Stack, and Database Systems, pursuing my Master’s at Kent State University. I spend my days working as a Graduate Research Assistant, building AI systems for real-world medical imaging, and as a Teaching Assistant, helping students understand Operating Systems and Databases without losing their sanity.",
  "I like building things that feel right, not just code that works, but systems that are efficient, clean, and meaningful. I enjoy breaking down complex problems, finding patterns, and turning chaos into something structured.",
  "People who’ve worked with me usually notice one thing: I’m easy to work with. I listen, I understand, and I don’t bring ego into the room.",
  "Outside engineering, I write stories, poems, and songs. I’ve been on stage as an actor and debater, and I’ve represented campuses, worked in bookstores, cafés, catering setups, and real service environments.",
  "I don’t just build applications. I build experiences, relationships, and ideas.",
  "And if nothing else, I promise I’ll at least fix the bugs… or become friends with them.",

              I’m a Software Engineer specializing in AI/ML and Full-Stack Development, currently pursuing 
              my Master’s at Kent State University, where I build scalable, real-world systems.
              I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, efficient solutions while collaborating 
              with people and creating meaningful impact through technology.
              Beyond code, I bring creativity, strong communication, and a calm, reliable presence
              someone teams enjoy working with and trust to get things done.
